        panes are the items that live in the stream, and they are the primary unit of content.
        here are the different kinds of panes:
        (1) narration panes (section elements)
            i.e. the pane that holds the title and byline or the pane that holds the project discription and how to navigate.
            these generally take up the full width and height of the window.
            they have h1, h2, or p tags that contain, at most, a few sentences of content.
        (2) interactive panes (article elements)
            i.e. the exeuctions by county heatmap or the word cloud of last words.
            these generally take up the full width and height of the window.
            they contain interactive visualizations of data.
            they are meant to stand alone and should be deep-linkable.
        (3) essay panes (article elements)
            i.e. the colophon, the about section. the interlude on botched executions.
            these can take up more than the full height of the window.
            they contain short essays.
            they are meant to stand alone and should be deep-linkable.
        (4) clickable name panes (article elements)
            i.e. gary gilmore's name and article
            these have two states
            (A) expanded
                can be given the class essay or interactive and then turn into one of those or a hybrid of them.
                in this state, these should be stand-alone and deep-linkable.
            (B) collapsed
                in every way the same as (5) (below) but on click turns into mode (4A).
                in this state, neither stand-alone nor deep-linkable
                (it should be given the <article> element nonetheless, as it is stand-alone in its truest form)
        (5) static name panes (section elements)
            i.e. john smith's name
            these show only a name.
            when a name is in the center position, it shows the race, crime, and method of execution for that person in-line.
            if there are last words associated with it, those appear in div.last-words-wrapper.
        panes also have the id element that is the unique name for each pane. each id is namespaced with `pane-`.
        the year marker elements are not displayed; they are hooks for javascript so that we can deep-link to a specific year.
        they have the id element that is unique for each year. they begin `year-marker-`.
